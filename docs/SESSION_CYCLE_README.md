# 🔄 Session Cycle Implementation for Defocus2Focus

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **Defocus → Focus → Unlock** session cycle system for your Defocus2Focus app with strong UX and persistent state management. The system ensures users maintain a healthy balance between focused work and mindful breaks.

## ✨ Core Features Implemented

### 🔒 **Session Cycle Logic**

- **Defocus Lock**: After using any defocus activity, all defocus features are locked
- **Focus Requirement**: Users must complete a focus session to unlock defocus again
- **Cycle Completion**: Each completed focus session unlocks defocus for the next cycle
- **Daily Reset**: Cycle counters reset daily, but session state persists

### 🎯 **State Management**

- **FocusContext**: Global state management using React Context API
- **AsyncStorage Persistence**: All session state survives app restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: UI immediately reflects state changes
- **Session Tracking**: Complete cycle tracking with statistics

### 🎨 **Enhanced UX**

- **Visual Lock Indicators**: Lock icons (🔒) and grayed-out buttons when defocus is locked
- **Friendly Messages**: Clear, encouraging messages explaining the cycle
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebration messages when cycles are completed
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual cycle counter with completion dots

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Core Components**

#### 1. **FocusContext** (`src/contexts/FocusContext.js`)

```javascript
// Global state management for session cycles
const {
  isDefocusAvailable, // Check if defocus is unlocked
  isDefocusLocked, // Check if defocus is locked
  isFocusActive, // Check if focus session is running
  startDefocus, // Start defocus session (locks defocus)
  endDefocus, // End defocus session
  startFocus, // Start focus session
  endFocus, // End focus session (unlocks defocus)
  completedCyclesToday, // Number of completed cycles today
} = useFocus();
```

#### 2. **DefocusButton** (`src/components/DefocusButton.js`)

- **Smart State Handling**: Automatically shows locked/unlocked states
- **Visual Feedback**: Lock icons, tooltips, and color coding
- **User Guidance**: Helpful messages when defocus is locked
- **Quick Reset**: Always-available breathing exercise option

#### 3. **CycleCounter** (`src/components/CycleCounter.js`)

- **Progress Visualization**: Shows completed cycles with dots
- **Motivational Messages**: Dynamic encouragement based on progress
- **Compact Mode**: Can be displayed in headers or small spaces
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates immediately when cycles complete

#### 4. **QuickResetModal** (`src/components/QuickResetModal.js`)

- **Always Available**: Works even when defocus is locked
- **Guided Breathing**: 4-2-6 breathing pattern with animations
- **Calming Design**: Soothing colors and smooth animations
- **Timer Integration**: Shows remaining time with countdown

### **Enhanced Screens**

#### 1. **EnhancedDefocusBreak** (`src/screens/EnhancedDefocusBreak.js`)

- **Session-Aware UI**: Shows different states based on session cycle
- **Activity Buttons**: Journaling, Mini Game, AI Therapist with lock states
- **Quick Reset**: Always-available breathing exercise
- **Status Display**: Clear indication of current session state

#### 2. **EnhancedFocusSession** (`src/screens/EnhancedFocusSession.js`)

- **Cycle Integration**: Automatically unlocks defocus when completed
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress ring and timer
- **Completion Rewards**: Celebration messages and cycle counting
- **Session Management**: Start, pause, resume, and stop functionality

#### 3. **EnhancedDashboard** (`src/screens/EnhancedDashboard.js`)

- **Cycle Overview**: Shows current cycle status and progress
- **Quick Actions**: Smart buttons that reflect current state
- **Session Statistics**: Today's focus time and cycle count
- **Motivational Tips**: Context-aware tips based on session state

## 🔄 Session Cycle Flow

### **1. Initial State**

```
🌿 Defocus Available → User can take breaks
```

### **2. After Defocus Use**

```
🔒 Defocus Locked → User must complete focus session
Message: "✨ You're ready to focus now! Defocus will unlock after your session."
```

### **3. During Focus Session**

```
🎯 Focus Active → Defocus remains locked
Message: "🎯 Focus session in progress. Defocus will unlock when you complete your session."
```

### **4. After Focus Completion**

```
🌿 Defocus Unlocked → Cycle complete, defocus available again
Message: "🎉 Great job completing your focus cycle!"
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

### **AsyncStorage Keys**

- `focusSessionState`: Complete session state
- `userData`: Existing user data (unchanged)

### **Persistent State**

```javascript
{
  isFocusActive: false,        // Focus session running
  isDefocusUsed: false,        // Defocus has been used
  isDefocusLocked: false,      // Computed lock state
  currentFocusSession: null,   // Current session data
  completedCyclesToday: 0,     // Daily cycle count
  lastCycleDate: null,         // Date tracking
}
```

### **Daily Reset Logic**

- Cycle counters reset at midnight
- Defocus usage resets for new day
- Focus state resets for new day
- Historical data preserved

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### **Visual States**

#### **Available State**

- ✅ Green color scheme
- 🌿 Leaf icon
- "Available" label
- Full functionality

#### **Locked State**

- 🔒 Lock icon overlay
- Grayed-out appearance
- "Locked" label
- Helpful tooltip on hover

#### **Active State**

- 🎯 Blue color scheme
- Pulsing animation
- "Active" label
- Progress indicators

### **User Messages**

#### **Lock Messages**

- **Defocus Used**: "✨ You're ready to focus now! Defocus will unlock after your session."
- **Focus Active**: "🎯 Focus session in progress. Defocus will unlock when you complete your session."

#### **Completion Messages**

- **First Cycle**: "🎉 Great job completing your first focus cycle!"
- **Multiple Cycles**: "🎉 Excellent! You've completed X focus cycles today!"
- **High Achievement**: "🚀 Amazing! You've completed X focus cycles today! You're on fire!"

### **Quick Reset Feature**

- **Always Available**: Works even when defocus is locked
- **1-Minute Duration**: Short, manageable breathing exercise
- **Guided Animation**: 4-2-6 breathing pattern
- **Calming Design**: Soothing colors and smooth transitions

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **State Transitions**

```javascript
// Defocus → Locked
startDefocus() → isDefocusUsed = true → isDefocusLocked = true

// Focus → Active
startFocus() → isFocusActive = true → isDefocusLocked = true

// Focus → Complete → Unlocked
endFocus() → isFocusActive = false → isDefocusUsed = false → isDefocusLocked = false
```

### **Helper Functions**

```javascript
// Check availability
isDefocusAvailable(); // Returns true if defocus can be used

// Get user-friendly messages
getDefocusLockMessage(); // Returns appropriate lock message
getCycleCompletionMessage(); // Returns celebration message

// Get statistics
getSessionStats(); // Returns current session statistics
```

### **Error Handling**

- **Graceful Degradation**: App works even if AsyncStorage fails
- **State Recovery**: Automatically recovers from corrupted state
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery options
- **Fallback Values**: Default values for missing data

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Basic Session Cycle**

```javascript
import { useFocus } from "../contexts/FocusContext";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { startDefocus, startFocus, endFocus, isDefocusAvailable } = useFocus();

  const handleDefocus = () => {
    if (isDefocusAvailable()) {
      startDefocus("journaling", 10); // 10 minutes
      // Navigate to journaling screen
    }
  };

  const handleFocus = () => {
    const session = startFocus({ duration: 25, type: "pomodoro" });
    // Start focus timer
  };

  const handleCompleteFocus = () => {
    const result = endFocus();
    // Show completion message
    console.log(`Cycle completed: ${result.cycleCompleted}`);
  };
};
```

### **DefocusButton Usage**

```javascript
<DefocusButton
  type="journaling"
  title="Journaling"
  icon="book"
  color="#8b5cf6"
  duration={10}
  onPress={() => handleDefocusActivity("journaling", 10)}
/>
```

### **CycleCounter Usage**

```javascript
<CycleCounter style={styles.counter} showMessage={true} compact={false} />
```
