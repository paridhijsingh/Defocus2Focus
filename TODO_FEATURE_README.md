- **NotificationService.js** - Push notification handling

### Data Persistence

### Native Components

- **React Native Paper** - Material Design components

- completeSubtask(taskId, subtaskId)

// New data structure
- todoList: Array of task objects
- categories: Array of category definitions
```

### Navigation
